# LilyBot 4.8.5

This update fixes a bug and deprecate log uploading.
You can find the full changelog below

New:
* Tags can now be 4096 characters long, quite why you'd want a tag that's 4kB long I don't know, but you can do that now
* Lily will send a message in a gallery channel when permissions are broken for her

Change:
* Role menu buttons are now GuildButtons
* Upgradle to 8.1.1
* The role mention check now takes into account the `Mention @everyone, @here and All Roles` permission

Fix:
* Old tags are no longer deleted before the new tag is validated fixing wierd issues in editing
* Hopefully stop reminder randomly disappearing and subsequently multi-pinging as we're properly checking reminders before deleting them now
